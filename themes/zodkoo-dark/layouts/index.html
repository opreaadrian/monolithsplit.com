                      <p>You're working in loss-prevention mode. You are becoming risk-averse and your team is only replicating the behavior.
                      All initiatives are seen as too risky and are shut down before they get the chance to prove their value.
                      You have every available team member ready to jump in and put out fires.
                      Deployments are a pain, so you deploy rarely. The process is either undocumented or too difficult to follow.
                      Technology is moving too fast for you to be working like this!<br><br>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered how is it that your competition is always ahead of you? You probably thought it's because they have bigger budgets, better developers or better marketing staff. They might even have a saurcerer somewhere.<br>
                    You experimented with bigger budgets and increasing the headcount. All you ended up doing was wasting more money.</p>
                    <p>Take a look at companies like Amazon, Netflix or Google. They have amazing R&amp;D budgets and a huge talent pool. They don't use that sheer force to push things in the right direction. They work smarter.
                    Ever heard of Amazon's 2-pizza-teams? That's what they use to develop things like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

                    <h4>Stop adding features to that old monolith. Start implementing microservices.</h4>
                    <p>That's right! Although it sounds like nonsense, stopping the feature-bloat on your current application is the way to make more money. Start splitting that huge chunk of code into money-making services, architected around your business!</p>
                    <p>Remember that mobile application you wanted to build? Did you end up dropping it because it involved too much work?
                    With microservices you can think of a mobile app, a web app or a desktop app as representations of your data! You could even create a command line interface for the terminal-loving clients!</p>
                    <p>There's just no room for 6-month release cycles. Technology is moving too fast and changing the world around us. With companies deploying multiple times a day, it's hard not to be left behind.</p>
                    <p>Microservices enable you to deploy as many times you like and perform experiments that would otherwise seem impossible due to the big "blast radius" in a monolithic architecture.</p>

                    <p>Why have your team waste time in uncharted territory? Lack of knowledge when migrating to microservices can become costly.</p>
                    <p> There's no point in hiding the fact that this can quickly turn into a 2-month project for 4-5 team members. Assume an average of $100/hour which is a really low rate, in 2 months you'll end up paying around $54.000 for that research. And I'm not even mentioning the remaining capacity for the ongoing firefighting. Or the time needed for people to agree on specific concepts and terms.</p>
                    <p>If you think you can't just pause your business for 2 months, I totally agree! Let me put my experience to work for you. In the past couple of years, I helped clients migrate from huge single-codebase applications, to slim, easy to maintain microservices. I implemented continuous deployment pipelines, took part in software development and helped with key technical decisions.<p>
                    <p>Let's have a meeting and assess your situation. Let me understand your business and I can provide you a set of detailed materials tailored to your specific needs. This will give you and your team a good starting point for your microservices migration.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the businesses I've helped over the past 2 years, you won't be starting from the bottom. You'll start with a solid plan and the proper knowledge, readily available to your team.</p>

                    <h4>Are you legit?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I am! This, as well as <a href="https://oprea.rocks">oprea.rocks</a> and many other entities to come, belong to me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/opreageorgeadrian">Adrian George Oprea</a> and the company I own NEURON01 DEVELOPMENT SRL.<br>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">Get in touch</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>How will you help me?</h4>
                    <p>We will have 1-2 meetings during which I will do my best to understand your business. We will identify together your current issues. We will look at what  drives revenue to you as well as discuss your plans for the future. Every person who can provide relevant input will be involved.<br>
                    After collecting all the information I will put together a plan, tailored to your needs, to help you and your team with your microservices migration.</p>

                    <h4>Can you help me build a team?</h4>
                    <p>I can help guide you through the process of recruiting skilled people to achieve your business goals. I can act as a sounding board for you, and provide information based on my experience recruiting technical people.<br>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">I need to build a team</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>What if I have a really big project?</h4>
                    <p>If you think you have a huge project and your requirements go past what I outlined above, email me directly and let's see how I can help you.<br>

                    <h4>Why should I choose you over X Consulting Corp.?</h4>
                    <p>Being a solo consultant might seem like a disadvantage, at first. It is this exact feature that enables me to be so proficient. I don't need to deploy a full-blown team of Business Analysts, legal department and four requirements engineers to roam your headquarters. I can understand your business and provide value without any of that. I don't do capacity planning. I can only work on 2 projects in parallel. This makes me more focused on your needs and reduces the oh-so-expensive context-switching.<br>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">I want fast delivery</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>Do you offer trainings?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I do! Let's get in touch, assess your business needs, your project needs and your team needs.<br>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">I need training</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>What if I only want to pick your brain?</h4>
                    <p>If that's what you want, <a href="">contact me</a> and let's set everything up so you can gain quick access to my "smarts".<br>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">I want to pick your brain</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>What if I want revisions or clarification after delivery?</h4>
                    <p>This is precisely why every plan has regular check-in period. I don't want to drop you a report and some documents and flee into the dark. We'll have constant communication and I will do my best to properly explain all the sections that seem unclear.<br><br></p>
