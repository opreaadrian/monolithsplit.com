                      <p>You're working in loss-prevention mode. Everyone on your team is risk-averse.
                      Initiatives are too risky and are shut down before they get the chance to prove their worth.
                      You have every available team member ready to jump in and put out fires.<br>
                      Deployments are a pain, so you deploy rarely. The process is either undocumented or too difficult to follow.
                      Technology is moving too fast for you to be working like this!<br><br>

                    <p>Long story, short: experienced Node.js professionals are hard to find. <br>
                    If you have good Node.js developers onboard, the last thing you'd want is to see them leave.
                    You know how hard it is to even interview people with the proper level of experience, let alone convince them to work for you.</p>
                    <p>If they already started leaving, you need to act fast.</p>
                    <p>If you ask me, having to run from one emergency to the next, is probably what's pushing them to leave.</p>

                    <h4>You're throwing money out the window!</h4>
                    <p>The reason you're running on Node.js is probably because it allows you to deliver fast. It probably offered the best building blocks for your business.<br>
                        However, although you're running on this amazing platform, it looks like your competition is always ahead of you.
                        You probably think it's because they have bigger budgets, better developers or better marketing staff.<br>
                    You even experimented yourself. You tried bigger budgets and increasing the headcount. All you ended up doing was wasting more money.</p>
                    <p>Take a look at companies like Amazon, Netflix or Google. They have amazing R&amp;D budgets and a huge talent pool. They don't use that sheer force to push things in the right direction. They work smarter.
                    Ever heard of Amazon's 2-pizza-teams? That's what they use to develop things like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

                    <h4>Stop adding features to your Node.js monolith. Start implementing microservices.</h4>
                    <p>That's right! Although it sounds like nonsense, stopping the feature-bloat on your current application is the way to make more money. 
                    Start splitting it into money-making services, architected around your business!</p>
                    <p>Remember that mobile application you wanted to build? Did you end up dropping it because it involved too much work?
                    With microservices you can think of a mobile app, a web app or a desktop app as representations of your data! You could even create a command line interface for the terminal-loving clients!</p>
                    <p>There's just no room for 6-month release cycles. We need to move faster! With companies deploying multiple times a day, it's hard not to be left behind.</p>
                    <p>Node.js microservices will enable you to deploy as many times you like. You can experiment with things that would otherwise seem impossible due to the big "blast radius" in a monolithic architecture.</p>

                    <p>Why have your team waste time in uncharted territory? Lack of knowledge when migrating to microservices can become costly.</p>
                    <p>It can quickly turn into a 2-month project for the whole team. For a team of 5 and a yearly average salary of $90.000, you'll end up paying around $75.000 for 2 months of research. 
                        This doesn't account for all the taxes and other expenses on your end. And I'm not even mentioning the ongoing firefighting or the time people need to agree on specific concepts and terms.</p>
                    <p>Pausing the business for 2 months is not an option. Let me put my experience to work for you. The past couple of years, I helped clients migrate from large Node.js applications, to slim, easy to maintain microservices. 
                        I implemented continuous deployment pipelines, took part in software development and helped with key technical decisions.<p>
                    <p>Help me understand your business and I will help you make more money! You'll get a rich migration guide (90+ pages) tailored to your buisness needs. All this for a small fraction, compared to the ROI.</p>
                    <p>You'll start your microservices migration with a solid plan and the proper knowledge, readily available to your team.</p>

                    <h4>Are you legit?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I am! This, as well as <a href="https://oprea.rocks">oprea.rocks</a> and many other entities to come, belong to me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/opreageorgeadrian">Adrian George Oprea</a> and the company I own NEURON01 DEVELOPMENT SRL.<br>
                    <a href="/contact" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">Get in touch</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>How will you help me?</h4>
                    <p>We will have 1-2 meetings during which I will do my best to understand your business. We will identify together your current issues. We will look at what  drives revenue to you as well as discuss your plans for the future. Every person who can provide relevant input will be involved.<br>
                    After collecting all the information I will put together a plan, tailored to your needs, to help you and your team with your microservices migration.</p>

                    <h4>Can you help me build a team?</h4>
                    <p>I can help guide you through the process of recruiting skilled people to achieve your business goals. I can act as a sounding board for you, and provide information based on my experience recruiting technical people.<br>

                    <h4>What if I have a really big project?</h4>
                    <p>If you think you have a huge project and your requirements go past what I outlined above, email me directly and let's see how I can help you.<br>

                    <h4>Why only Node.js applications?</h4>
                    <p>This is my area of expertise. I've been working with JavaScript since 2005 and with Node.js since 2011. I understand how Node.js works and I've seen all sorts of projects built with it. It enables me to give valuable advice,
                    not just generic truths you can find while browsing the Internet.<br>

                    <h4>Why should I choose you over X Consulting Corp.?</h4>
                    <p>Being a solo consultant might seem like a disadvantage, at first. It is this exact feature that enables me to be so proficient. I don't need to deploy a full-blown team of Business Analysts, legal department and four requirements engineers to roam your headquarters. I can understand your business and provide value without any of that. I don't do capacity planning. I can only work on 2 projects in parallel. This makes me more focused on your needs and reduces the oh-so-expensive context-switching.<br>

                    <h4>Do you offer trainings?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I do! Let's get in touch, assess your business needs, your project needs and your team needs.<br>
                    <a href="/contact" class="btn btn-sm btn-custom">I need training</a><br><br></p>

                    <h4>What if I only want to pick your brain?</h4>
                    <p>If that's what you want, <a href="">contact me</a> and let's set everything up so you can gain quick access to my "smarts".<br>

                    <h4>What if I want revisions or clarification after delivery?</h4>
                    <p>This is precisely why every plan has regular check-in period. I don't want to drop you a report and some documents and flee into the dark. We'll have constant communication and I will do my best to properly explain all the sections that seem unclear.<br><br></p>
